### Structure Explanation
I have adopted the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to address this problem. Instead of organizing the source code by folders such as Model, ViewModel, etc.,
I chose to structure it by screen. This approach facilitates easier maintenance and updates.
Additionally, I created a common.swift file to define all common functionalities required in the project.
For larger projects, this can be divided into a Common folder, with each common functionality split into individual classes as necessary.
I also established an API folder to house all implementations related to API calls.

### Note
In my experience, I have worked for a Japanese company for approximately four years, during which I predominantly used Xcode with UIKit to develop applications.
While I haven't yet worked on a real SwiftUI project, I am actively studying it and am excited about its powerful capabilities.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with your team!
